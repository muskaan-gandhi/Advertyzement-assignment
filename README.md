# Adevertyzement-assignment

The task is to create the user card grid from the given data "https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1" by making api call on clicking the button and show the loader before the grid is displayed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
First of all I created a react app named advertyzement by running "npx create-react-app advertyzement" command in the terminal having npm as the node manager.

# Installing dependencies.
Dependencies used for the assignment : 

  (i)Axios used to fetch data from the API => 
              installation = npm install axios
              usage = import axios from "axios";
              
  (ii)React Spinners CSS Loaders is a collection of React spinners components with pure css these are based on loading.io and from all over the web.
              installation = npm i --save react-spinners-css  
              usage = import { Roller } from 'react-spinners-css'; 

# Algorithm
By using React hooks usestate, I declared the initial value for data as null and loader as false.
In fetchData I used async-await along with axios to fetch the data from API and also set the loader off.
Later with useEffect I set the timeout for the loader of 2s.

At last I returned the fetchData by using onClick property of button after showing loading screen for 2 seconds the User card grid layout is displayed on the screen.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
